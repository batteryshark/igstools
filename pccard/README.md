# ISG A27 ASIC Driver 

This kernel module represents the last known working configuration of the A27 driver for IGS games. Note - different games program different functions, but the driver itself should work the same.


Also included are original kernel modules, idbs from IDA, and an idb of the linux kernel with the A27 sections marked. At some point, kernel modules were no longer used and the code was embedded into the kernel.
